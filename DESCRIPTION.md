# onetimepad

I always wondered how the old secret agent movies would translate into current time. Listening to number sations, hastly scribbeling town letters onto a sheet of paper, reading off your orders and then the paper self igniting just as you finish reading...

I mean who has pen and paper with them any more? Well some Non-specific Agency (NSA) moved the self igniting paper into the cloud and called them "One Time Pads", as they are proven to be secure.
